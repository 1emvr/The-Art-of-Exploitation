Let's disassemble a virus. Any debugger should work:
```
 -u100
 14CF:0100 E99004        JMP     0593     ; Jumpt to the address 593h
 14CF:0103 3F            AAS              ; The rest of the code, as you
 14CF:0104 95            XCHG    BP,AX    ; can see, is encrypted and has
 14CF:0105 D7            XLAT             ; no sense at all %-)
 14CF:0106 29A6C13F      SUB     [BP+3FC1],SP
 14CF:010A 8FD7          POP     DI
 14CF:010C 29A2C13F      SUB     [BP+SI+3FC1],SP
 14CF:0110 16            PUSH    SS
 14CF:0111 D7            XLAT
 14CF:0112 7F6E          JG      0182
```

 Now we go to address 593h and find rest of the decrypted code:
```

 -u593
 14CF:0593 BE0001     MOV     SI,0100  ; 100h address of actual jmp 593h
 14CF:0596 56         PUSH    SI       ; Save SI
 14CF:0597 B94A02     MOV     CX,024A  ; Number of bytes to decrypt
 14CF:059A C70429D8   MOV     WORD PTR [SI],D829  ; d829 at 100h
 14CF:059E C64402C1   MOV     BYTE PTR [SI+02],C1 ; c1h at 102h
 14CF:05A2 8134C1D7   XOR     WORD PTR [SI],D7C1  ; d7c1h at SI. If we look
                                                  ; at 100h we'll find a
                                                  ; call c212h
```

If we now look at the header being decrypted, we find that at address `100h`, instead of a jump to `593h` there's a different instruction.
