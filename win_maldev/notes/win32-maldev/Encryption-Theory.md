1. Theory

There are several encrytpion levels. Simple OR/XOR or combinations of OR/XOR/NOT etc.

Encrypted malware has the following execution structure:

	- May have a jump to the malware code (eg Maltese Amoeba) 
	or at the beginning of the file (Jerusalem)
	- Decryption Routine
	- Malware Code
	- Jump to the infected file's code

The decryption routine consists of a series of instructions that turn encrypted code into instructions. In or der to do this, several logical operations are performed on the encrypted bytes.
