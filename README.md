# The Art of Exploitation - Binary Exploitation and Analysis

This is a collection of scripts from the book
and an attempt to get a better understanding of
Assembly and the C language.

If you find anything wrong in my notes, feel free to contact me with corrections/feedback.
I'm always looking to learn and improve and I'd rather be told that i'm wrong than to reamin wrong.
